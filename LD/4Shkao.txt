# having now loaded the file in some way, I attempted two things. the first was using pathview directly to map:
pv.out <- pathview(gene.data = testwithKO_ONE_COLUMN_ONLY, pathway.id = "00430" , species = "ko", out.suffix = "20180131", kegg.native = T, node.sum = "max" , gene.idtype = "KEGG", cpd.idtype = "KEGG")
Note: Only KEGG ortholog gene ID is supported, make sure it looks like "K01488"!
Note: None of the genes or compounds mapped to the pathway!
Argument gene.idtype or cpd.idtype may be wrong.

 # with this not working, I went a step back and tried to use mol.sum to take the mean of the duplicate values. I didn't save this code but looked something like this:
 testwithKO_ONE_COLUMN_ONLY <- mol.sum(mol.data="kegg", id.map, , sum.method ="mean" id.map = testwithKO)
 # the problem with this code is I have no idea what to put in for id.map, it just returns an empty matrix I think
